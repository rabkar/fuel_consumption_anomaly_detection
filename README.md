# fuel_consumption_anomaly_detection

This project is part of predictive maintenance in my company that aims to optimize fuel consumption in mining operation. The biggest portion of cost structure in mining industry is fuel, so that is wht this kind of project will be significant.. 

The idea is to detect anomaly based on operation behaviour then relate it to fuel consumption and then create an alert to the person in charge to immediately inspect the equipment.
